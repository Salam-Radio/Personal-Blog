            <h2>How to do the thing when depressed</h2>

            <p>That happens, we can sometimes fall into emotional rock bottomsâ€”moments when we feel overwhelmed, hopeless, and stuck. During these times, it's essential to develop the skill of learned optimism, a powerful tool for bouncing back faster and building resilience, which is a good thing imho.</p>
            <p>Learned optimism is the concept that our responses to adversity can be changed through cognitive restructuring which was developed by Martin Seligman and that other guy, I fogot his name. Here are some techniques to help you cultivate this skill:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Practice contestation of pessimistic thoughts:</strong> Challenge negative thoughts and replace them with positive facts. For example, you have belief "I can't do this," try something like "I already faced that, also the friend of mine had similar problems and got through, so can I, maybe I can ask that person for help or maybe read an article about it and subscribe to its newsletters (wink-wink)."</li>
                <li><strong>Foster a Growth Mindset:</strong> Embrace setbacks as opportunities for growth. Understand that failure is not a permanent condition, but positive results are stepping stones to your goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Seek Social Support:</strong> Connect with friends, family, or a therapist who can provide emotional support and a different perspective on your situation.</li>
                <li><strong>Set Realistic Goals:</strong> Break down your challenges into smaller, manageable steps. Achieving these mini-goals can boost your confidence and motivation.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Gratitude:</strong> I hate this practice, but still reflect on the positive aspects of your life. Gratitude can shift your focus away from negativity and make you feel better, doesn't work for me personally, but for you can.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Doing the thing takes time and effort, but learned optimism can significantly improve your mental and emotional well-being and capability. By developing this skill, you'll not only recover faster from emotional rock bottoms but also build the resilience to face future challenges with a positive mindset, which is sick.</p>
